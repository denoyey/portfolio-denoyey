# 🚀 Denoy's Portfolio

Welcome to my personal corner of the web! This isn't just a static portfolio; it's a playground where I experiment with modern UI trends, responsive interactive layouts, and seamless user experiences.

Built with **React** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**, this project showcases a "Bento Grid" design philosophy—organizing complex information into clean, digestible, and visually stunning blocks.

## ✨ Highlights & Features

Here’s what makes this portfolio special:

- **Bento Grid Layout**: A responsive, masonry-style grid that adapts perfectly from mobile phones to ultra-wide displays. It breaks the monotony of traditional linear scrolling.
- **Premium Glassmorphism**: Leveraging backdrop filters, subtle borders, and deep shadows to create a layered, frosted-glass look that feels modern and expensive.
- **Interactive "Alive" Elements**:
  - Skill cards that glow and pop with their brand colors (Docker Blue, Laravel Red, etc.) upon interaction.
  - A "Services" section with automatic breathing animations to signify active processes.
- **Dynamic Project Showcase**: A custom-built, paginated grid system for browsing projects without leaving the main view.
- **Dark Mode Native**: Designed from the ground up for dark mode enthusiasts, using a carefully curated slate color palette.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Core**: React.js (Vite)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Remix Icon
- **Animation**: Pure CSS Transitions & Keyframes (Custom Tailwind config)
- **Routing**: React Router DOM

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

I believe websites should be fun to use. Every hover state, every transition, and every pixel of padding was calculated to provide a satisfying tactile feel. The goal was to move away from "boring corporate resumes" and build something that reflects the creativity of a developer.
